## 🧩 Business Problem

Companies often suffer losses due to inefficient vendor management, high freight costs, or poor inventory turnover.  
This project addresses:

- Identifying underperforming vendors for corrective actions  
- Analyzing top contributors to sales and profit  
- Understanding the effect of bulk orders on cost savings  
- Detecting slow-moving or unsold inventory  
- Assessing dependency risks on key vendors  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

**Data Source:** `inventory.db` (SQLite database)  
Contains tables for purchases, sales, freight, and vendor details.

Approx. **25K+ records**, covering:
- Vendor information  
- Sales & purchase transactions  
- Freight and excise data  
- Pricing and volume metrics

## 🔍 Data Preparation

- Connected to SQLite database via **SQLAlchemy**  
- Cleaned missing values and removed zero/negative profit entries  
- Merged purchase, sales, and freight data using **SQL CTEs**  
- Aggregated brand- and vendor-level performance metrics  

---

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings

### Data Highlights
- Negative/zero profit entries identified and excluded  
- Unsold inventory → slow-moving SKUs detected  
- High freight outliers up to ₹2.57L  

### Correlation
- Purchase Qty ↔ Sales Qty → **Strong (0.999)**  
- Profit Margin ↔ Sales Price → **Weak Negative (−0.179)**  

### Business Insights
- 🔹 198 brands with low sales but high margins → target for promotions  
- 🔹 Top 10 vendors account for **65.7%** of purchases → dependency risk  
- 🔹 **72% unit cost savings** via bulk purchasing  
- 🔹 **$2.71M unsold stock** → inventory lockup  
- 🔹 Significant margin gap between top and bottom vendors
